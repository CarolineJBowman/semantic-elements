     <h1>Semantic Elements</h1>
     <h2><em>The case for clearer code</em></h2>
     <p>HTML has had various different iterations since it was created
     and has not always functioned well across browsers, between countries,
     or even from developer to developer. For HTML5, semantic elements seek
     to provide more clear and intuitive elements with the goal of
     streamlining the language. One clear case for semantic elements is that
     it reduces the need for the commonly used element &lt;div&gt;, or the HTML
     Content Division Element, that has been used almost as a catchall
     element, resulting in an overused and unclear tag, making it harder to
     translate, inconsistent between developers, and clunky when it comes to
     a reliable HTML style guide. To combat this, semantic elements like
     &lt;article&gt;, &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;section&gt; more clearly describe
     how they will be used within the language, reducing the need for overused
     and unclear element tags. All in all, semantic elements make HTML a more
     universal and clean language."</p>

     <em>&lt;div&gt; is an element that is useful until it isn't. Since it
     needs to be assigned an id and additional attributes to be useful, it can
     become tedious to the developer or anyone/any browser interpreting
     it.</em>

     <summary><b>But when should you use &lt;div&gt;?</b></summary>
     <p>&lt;div&gt; is still useful even if it's not a semantic element.
     Be mindful of how you use it! Use it when:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>It's a generic element, so use it to contain semantic elements.</li>
       <li>No clear semantic element to use? Use &lt;div&gt;.</li>
       <li>Use it when you want to style a section of a semantic element
         differently.</li>
     </ul>
   </details>

   <p><strong> The Point:</strong> Semantic elements make HTML easier to
     read and interpret!</p>
